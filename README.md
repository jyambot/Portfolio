# Portfolio
Professional portfolio to showcase my awesomeness and coding abilities. As always, a work in progress.

Update 5/24
At first, I thought it would be a good idea to have all of the content already on the page before I applied any styling to it. This
turned out to be more confusing than I initially anticipated, so I commented everything out and tried to style everything one item 
at a time from the top down.

Currently, I'm stuck trying to figure out how to properly style the "Work" section. My idea was to have "Surf Report" as a flexbox
on the same level as the other four items, which would be in a flexbox of their own. In the simplest terms I can think of, a series 
of nested flexboxes.
